# docker scripts

The scripts below are based on documentation avaiable from docker's web site including:

[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

The uninstall scripts essentially reverse the scripts used to install the docker components.  These scripts have been test in Debian 11.2.

## deb_docker_install.sh
Installs docker and docker-conpose onto a Debian based Linux OS.

## deb_docker_uninstall.sh
Uninstall docker and docker-conpose from a Debian based Linux OS.
