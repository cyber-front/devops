# docker scripts

The scripts below are based on documentation avaiable from docker's web site including:

[Docker Install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
[Docker Compose Install](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

The uninstall scripts essentially reverse the scripts used to install the docker components.

## deb_docker_install.sh
Installs docker and docker-conpose onto a Debian based Linux OS (i.e. it requires apt).  This has been tested on Debian 11.2.
