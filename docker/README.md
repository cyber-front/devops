# Docker installers / uninstallers

The intent here is to include Docker installers for different Linux operating systems using different package managers.  The apt folder contains the installer and uninstaller for Debian derived platforms.

I started working on an installer / uninstaller for yum, but newer Red Hat derived Linux distributions ship with podman, a Docker alternative.  So it seemed kind of pointless to continue with it.

I'm open to including installers for Linux distros here... just let me know.
